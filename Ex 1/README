this program will preform discrete convolution based on values it gets from the user.
the user will feed the program 2 arrays and a number.
the first array is the sequence of volumes in each iteration,
while the second array is the sequence of the amplifier.
the number in the number of resonating chambers the experiment is being conducted in.

the program will run the convolution upon the series's and will output a visual result to the user.
my mathematical convolution works in O(N^2) as required.
im quite certain that i could have reached a running time of O(N*LOG(N)) have i used discrete fourier transform to
calculate the polynomial multiplication, but unfortunately i had a moed b to study for:(

the graphical results will consist of numbers describing a rounded result of the experiment, and based on the
max value in the result will print a number of stars(when it is normalized such that the max num of stars in 20).
and this way the mathematical convolution is graphically displayed to the user.
