######
this project consists of two parts, the static library infi.c, and the program NumaricAnalyzer.
the library hols function to calculate integrals and derivatives of functions.
the program will use the library and give certain information about certain functions.
the input of the program is as follows: NumericalAnalyzer <function number> <a> <b> <N> <x0> <h>
when:
a: is the number of the function from the function list
b: is the point of "start" in the integral calculation
N: number or partitions in the integral by reiman
x0: point to calc derivative
h: the "approximation" of the point to derive

if it will find an error it will print "Invalid input\n"
however if everything goes correctly it will print our info in this manner:
Integral: XXX
Derivative: XXX
